# Image-to-python-sketch-using-python-and-opencv
This is my first task of my internship with LetsGrowMore. Firstly in this project I have imported the image and then converted the image into grayscale . Then the grayscale image was converted to negative image and then it was blurred using Gaussian Blur. Finally the dodging method was applied to convert the image into a sketch.
